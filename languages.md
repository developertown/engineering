## Typescript / Javascript

At DeveloperTown projects should use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as an alternative to Javascript where possible.  We believe that Typescript creates a better developer experience.

1. Improves Developer Speed
2. Reduces Bugs
3. Does a better job documenting the code we write

## Terraform

[HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.
