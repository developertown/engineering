# Static Application Security Testing

DeveloperTown projects **should** utilize appropriate static application security testing tools.

## Why SAST?

Static application security testing (SAST) tools automatically scan the source code of an application. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities before deployment. SAST tools perform white-box testing, which involves analyzing the code based on inside knowledge of the application.

* Examine the codebase of an application in one test
* Test an application before compiling or running the code
* Identify vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle (SDLC), which is when vulnerabilities are easiest and cheapest to fix
