# Source Code Management

At DeveloperTown projects **should** leverage Azure DevOps for source code if the client does not have an alternative source code management tool.  DeveloperTown projects **should** use git whenever possible, we should encourage clients using TFVC or SVN to consider git for new projects.

## Why Git?

Git is decentralized, or distributed. This means that to edit, developers download the source code onto their local machines to work and make edits, while TFVC and SVN are centralized, meaning all developers are making edits to one master branch kept on a server and accessible to all team members.  Since Git is decentralized, developers can work offline and do not have to worry about the server being unavailable.
